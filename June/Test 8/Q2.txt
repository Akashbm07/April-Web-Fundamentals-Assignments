Question 2 : In how many ways can we loop in an array describe each with an example ?


    1. For Loop:

    A 'for' loop can be used to access every element of an array. The array begins at zero, and the array property length is used to set the loop end.

    Eg: 
        var mammals = new Array("cat","dog","human","whale","seal");
        var animalString = "";
        for (var i = 0; i < mammals. length; i++) {
        animalString += mammals[i] + " ";
        }
        alert(animalString);

    2. while loop :
 
    the index counter, i, is incremented as itâ€™s used to access an array element. The use of i++ means that the existing value of i is accessed first, and then the variable is incremented.

    Eg: 
        var numArray = new Array(1,4,66,123,240,444,555);
        var i = 0;

        while (numArray[i] < 100) {
            alert(numArray[i++]);
        }
