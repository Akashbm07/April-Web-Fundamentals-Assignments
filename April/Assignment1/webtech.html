<h1>WEB TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>HTML, in full hypertext markup language, a formatting system for displaying material retrieved over the Internet.
    Each retrieval unit is known as a Web.HTML is the markup language for encoding Web pages. It was designed by the
    British scientist Sir Tim Berners-Lee at the CERN nuclear physics laboratory in Switzerland during the 1980s.HTML
    markup tags specify document elements such as headings, paragraphs, and tables. They mark up a document for display
    by a computer program known as a Web browser. </p>

<H3>CSS</H3>
<P>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
    markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
    JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
    fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
    specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
    relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable
    the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web
    pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an
    interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities. JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but
    Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made
    its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has
    been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.</p>
