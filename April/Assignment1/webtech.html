    <h1>WEB TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML, in full hypertext markup language, a formatting system for displaying material retrieved over the Internet.
        Each retrieval unit is known as a Web.HTML is the markup language for encoding Web pages. It was designed by the
        British scientist Sir Tim Berners-Lee at the CERN nuclear physics laboratory in Switzerland during the
        1980s.HTML
        markup tags specify document elements such as headings, paragraphs, and tables. They mark up a document for
        display
        by a computer program known as a Web browser. </p>
    <p>
        HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
        content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium
        (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS
        over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

    <h4>CSS</h4>
    <P>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
        markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
        JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
        fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
        specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
        relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and
        enable
        the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
        formatting.

    <h4>JavaScript</h4>
    <p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web
        pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an
        interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities. JavaScript was first known as LiveScript,
        but
        Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript
        made
        its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language
        has
        been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.</p>

    <h4>React.js</h4>
    <p>
        React.js is the most popular front-end JavaScript library for building Web applications. React.js or Reactjs or
        simply React are different ways to represent React.js. Most fortune 500 companies use Reactjs In this article,
        we will learn what React.js (or simply React or Reactjs) is and why we should use Reactjs instead of other
        JavaScript frameworks like Angular. React was first created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. React first deployed on Facebookâ€™s newsfeed in 2011 and on Instagram.com in 2012.
